
I'm Charith, your typical middle-class guy with a
 knack for finding joy in the everyday. Life's all 
 about balance for me. While I hit the books during 
 the week, you'll catch me kicking a soccer ball 
 around with friends or perfecting my lines for drama
club. Weekends are my time to unwind with family
movie nights and maybe a bike ride through the
 neighborhood. Sure, money's not overflowing
in our house, but that doesn't stop us from laughing
 over homemade pizza or planning our next adventure
together. School's where I mix work with a bit of fun, 
whether it's acing a test or cracking jokes with classmates.
I've got dreams as big as anyone, and I'm determined to chase 
them down, one step at a time.
